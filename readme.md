 *1. Project Overview*

1.1 *Project Title*
**Student Management System - Course Application and Management Module**

1.2 *Project Purpose*
This project aims to automate the management of student applications for courses, allowing administrators to handle course listings, accept student applications, and approve or decline applications based on specific criteria. The system provides a simple command-line interface for administrators to streamline these tasks.

*2. Problem Definition*

  2.1 *Problem Statement*
In many educational institutions, managing course applications can be a time-consuming and error-prone task. Typically, the process involves collecting applications, reviewing qualifications, and manually categorizing students as successful or unsuccessful. This project addresses the need for a streamlined and automated solution to manage and track student applications efficiently.

2.2 *Objectives*
1. Allow administrators to add new courses with unique identifiers and names.
2. Enable students to apply for courses, providing relevant personal details and a score.
3. Automate the approval or decline of student applications based on a predefined score threshold.
4. Facilitate easy listing of available courses, successful applicants, and unsuccessful applicants.
5. Provide a user-friendly interface that operates in a console environment.


 *3. Solution Overview*

3.1 *Solution Approach*
The solution is implemented as a console-based C program that uses file I/O to store and retrieve information, allowing persistence across sessions. Each function operates on different text files, representing various aspects of the system.

1. **File-Based Storage**:
   - `courses.txt`: Stores available courses.
   - `applications.txt`: Stores student applications.
   - `approved.txt`: Stores applications approved based on score threshold.
   - `declined.txt`: Stores applications declined due to insufficient scores.

2. **Functional Modules**:
   - **Add Available Course**: Allows the administrator to enter a course ID and course name, storing them in `courses.txt`.
   - **Apply for Course**: Enables students to submit applications, stored in `applications.txt`.
   - **Approve/Decline Applications**: Reads student applications and decides the outcome based on the predefined threshold score.
   - **List Available Courses**: Lists all available courses from `courses.txt`.
   - **List Successful and Unsuccessful Applicants**: Lists students based on whether they passed the score threshold.

3. **Looped User Interface**: The program presents a menu that allows users to select options repeatedly until they choose to exit.

### 3.2 **Technologies and Libraries Used**
- **C Standard Library**: `stdio.h` for file operations and `string.h` for string manipulation.

## **4. Code Explanation**

This section provides a brief explanation of each main function in the program:

1. **Main Menu and Choice Handling**: The main menu displays options and accepts user input for operation selection.

2. **Add Available Course**: Opens `courses.txt` in append mode, allowing the user to input a course ID and name, which is then saved to the file.

3. **Apply for Course**: Opens `applications.txt` in append mode and records student application details, including a score.

4. **Approve/Decline Applications**:
   - Reads each application from `applications.txt`.
   - Checks if the student's score meets the threshold.
   - Writes approved applications to `approved.txt` and declined applications to `declined.txt`.

5. **List Available Courses**: Reads and displays each course entry from `courses.txt`.

6. **List Successful and Unsuccessful Applicants**: Reads and displays entries from `approved.txt` and `declined.txt`, respectively.

## **6. Testing and Validation**

### 6.1 **Test Scenarios**
- **Adding a Course**: Check that `courses.txt` contains the new entry.
- **Applying for a Course**: Verify that `applications.txt` reflects the correct data.
- **Application Processing**: Ensure that the scores are evaluated correctly and that approved and declined files are updated accurately.
- **Listing Functions**: Confirm that courses, successful applicants, and unsuccessful applicants are displayed correctly.

### 6.2 **Error Handling**
The program handles incorrect menu choices and prompts the user to re-enter a valid choice. In case of file handling errors (like missing files), additional error-checking mechanisms could be added for robustness.
